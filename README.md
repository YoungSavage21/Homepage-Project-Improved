# Homepage-Project-Improved
https://youngsavage21.github.io/Homepage-Project-Improved

A simple homepage site I created for my mid-exam on the first semester. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of the things I implemented are learned from courses I found online.

# What I learned
- HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript array and object
