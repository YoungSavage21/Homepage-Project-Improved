# Homepage-Project-Improved
A simple homepage site I created for my mid-exam in semester 1. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of the things I implemented are learned from courses I found online.

# What I learned
- HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript array and object
